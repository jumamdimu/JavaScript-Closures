# JavaScript-Closures

### Definition
  A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
  In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
  In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
  
  JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.
  Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.
